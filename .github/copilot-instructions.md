<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a Python Snake game project using pygame for graphics and game logic. The game recreates the classic DOS-style Snake game with modern Python implementation.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Game Architecture
- Main game loop handles events, updates, and rendering
- Snake class manages snake movement and growth
- Food class handles food generation and consumption
- Game state management for different screens (menu, game, game over)
- Clean separation between game logic and rendering

## Dependencies
- pygame: Main game framework for graphics, sound, and input
- Standard Python libraries for basic functionality
